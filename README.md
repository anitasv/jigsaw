He didn't solve this part in the video, I thought I will take a crack at it, 
long story short simply throwing  entire problem  at SAT solver is not very efficient, probably 
solving edges first and moving in in separate steps and hints with a soler might be
more efficient. But for sizes up to 11x11 I was able to get this to work.
